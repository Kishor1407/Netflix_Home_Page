Welcome to the Netflix Homepage Clone repository. In this project, I've replicated the look and feel of the Netflix 
homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to practice web development skills by recreating a well-known
website.

Project Overview
This project is a clone of the Netflix homepage and includes the following features:

An accurate replica of the Netflix homepage's user interface.
Responsiveness for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Dynamic content loading and carousel navigation using JavaScript to mimic Netflix's functionality.
